# FitBitProgram

Program implements file manipulation, data cleansing, deduping and parsing to process a .csv file containing 24 hours of data loaded from a Fitbit Smartwatch. Data is stored into an array, where each record is composed of multiple fields in which each individual data element is stored. Each record contains the patient ID, number of steps, distance walked in miles, heart rate, sleep quality, floors climbed, and calories burned. Over the 24 hour period, the total calories burned, distance walked in miles, floors walked, steps taken, average heartrate and largest period of poor sleep are computed. The results of these computations are outputted to the .csv file, "Records.csv."
